## Deployment Plan

1. **GitHub Backup**
   - Commit current changes to GitHub as a backup
   - Ensure sensitive information is not included in commits

2. **Direct Vercel Deployment**
   - Use Vercel CLI to deploy directly (without GitHub integration)
   - Authorize through GitHub account
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify application is running correctly
   - Check that JSON reports are being loaded properly
   - Ensure all components are rendering correctly

## Issues to Address

- Duplicate pages detected: pages/api/latest-report.js and app/api/latest-report/route.ts
- Need to ensure docs directory with JSON files is included in deployment
- Need to set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard

## Next Steps

1. Commit changes to GitHub
2. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
3. Deploy to Vercel using CLI
4. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
5. Verify deployment
